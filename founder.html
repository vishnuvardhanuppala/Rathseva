            <h2>Meet Our Founder</h2>
            <p>Uppala Vishnu Vardhan is not just the founder of My Farmers — he is the heart and soul of this mission. A true visionary with a deep commitment to rural empowerment, Vishnu Vardhan's journey began with a simple but powerful realization: "Farmers deserve more than just survival — they deserve success."

                Raised with strong values and a respect for the agricultural backbone of our country, he made it his life’s goal to improve the post-harvest experience for farmers. Unlike traditional efforts focused solely on cultivation and production, Vishnu Vardhan set out to revolutionize what happens after the crops are harvested — when the true value of a farmer’s effort is decided.</p>
            <p>Vishnu Vardhan believes in technology with purpose — using data, digital tools, and market awareness to connect farmers directly with the information they need to make better decisions and secure better profits.

                Under his guidance, My Farmers is not just a company — it's a movement that honors the dignity of farmers, ensures transparency in the agri-market, and builds a bridge between rural producers and national/global consumers.</p>
            <p>He continues to inspire a new generation of changemakers to think beyond conventional boundaries and create real-world solutions for those who feed the nation.</p>
