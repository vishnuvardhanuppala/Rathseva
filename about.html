            <h2>ðŸŒ¾ About Us</h2>
            <p>Welcome to RaithuBandhuNet, a visionary initiative founded by Uppala Vishnu Vardhan with one clear mission â€” to uplift the lives of Indian farmers by ensuring transparency, awareness, and access to profitable post-harvest opportunities.

                In today's rapidly changing agricultural economy, farmers often face uncertainty about market prices, demand trends, and trade possibilities. Our platform bridges that gap by providing real-time updates on:</p>
                
               <p> âœ… Live crop prices across regions</p>
                
               <p> âœ… Current demand and low-demand alerts</p>
                
               <p>âœ… Availability of crops across India</p>
                
               <p>âœ… Insights on global trade and export opportunities.</p>
            <p>We are not just another agri-tech portal â€” we are a farmer-first movement. Every feature is designed to empower the hands that feed our nation. By leveraging technology, data, and deep market insights, we aim to ensure that no farmer is left behind after harvest.

                Uppala Vishnu Vardhan, a passionate advocate for rural development, founded this platform to transform the post-harvest journey into one of profit, dignity, and sustainability.</p>
